Background
----------
This project had an interesting beginning, when I chatted with an executive of Universal Music Group Nashville.
He thought it would be cool to have users' smartphones to flash different colors/patterns during a concert.
(remember those lighters?) I fully agreed with him. Then we brainstormed about many possibilities: when can we
expect near-field communication to happen; would indoor wi-fi be robust enough to reach all devices; what about
outdoor performances, etc, etc. The central issue is: we need a robust source to send control signals to smartphones.

Before long we came to an idea almost simultaneously: how about the soundwave itself? If the phone can catch those
incredibly loud sounds from a kick drum/cybal/baseguitar and act on them, then no infrastructure support is needed
at all. Plus, you don't have to teach musicians any technical stuff, the drumsticks are naturally the baton to 
coordinate smartphones.

So I started experimenting in my spare time. Thanks to [Nashville's music row](http://www.musicrow.com/), I never 
ran short of fieldtest grounds.
